    "   \n",
    "   - **Step 2: Explore the Code Structure**:\n",
    "     - Understand how the code is organized (e.g., preprocessing scripts, model training script, evaluation script).\n",

    "   - **Step 4: Study the Output**:\n",
    "     - Look at accuracy, loss curves, or any other performance metrics the code produces.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Propose Methods to Increase Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - Based on your review, suggest new methods to improve the FER system. For example:\n",
    "     - **Data Augmentation**: Suggest adding new augmentations (rotation, flipping, color jittering).\n",
    "     - **Model Improvement**: Propose using advanced architectures like EfficientNet or Vision Transformers.\n",
    "     - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Recommend more systematic tuning methods (e.g., Grid Search).\n",
